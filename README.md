# Credit Card Default Prediction 📊

**Project Objective:**  
The aim of this project was to analyze the factors predicting payment defaults among credit card customers of a bank, as well as to practice using Databricks.

## Tools Used 🛠️
- **Databricks** (data processing, visualizations, modeling)
- **PySpark** (data processing and analysis)
- **Machine Learning** (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest)
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (visualizations)

## Key Findings 🔑
Payment defaults are more likely if:
- There were delays in the customer’s previous monthly payments.
- The credit limit is low (further analysis is needed here).

The best-performing model was the decision tree, with an accuracy of 82%.

## Data 📅
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle, titled *Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset*.
